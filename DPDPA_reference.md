   - 18-month deadline is HARD
   - Board can impose retrospective penalties

2. **Treating consent as one-time:**
   - Must be specific, informed, for specific purpose
   - Easy withdrawal required

3. **Ignoring children's data:**
   - If any users might be <18, need verification
   - Tracking/advertising to children = ₹200 crore penalty

4. **Weak security:**
   - Generic "best practices" insufficient
   - Must implement Rule 6 minimums
   - ₹250 crore penalty exposure

5. **Slow breach response:**
   - 72 hours to Board is HARD deadline
   - "Without delay" to Data Principals means hours, not days

6. **Forgetting Data Processors:**
   - You're liable for processor's breaches
   - Must have contractual security requirements

7. **Not checking SDF status:**
   - Government may notify your company/category
   - Additional obligations immediately apply

8. **Assuming exemptions apply:**
   - Exemptions are narrow and specific
   - Document why exemption applies
